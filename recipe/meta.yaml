  summary: 'Adaptive parallel sampling of mathematical functions'
  description: |
    adaptive is an open-source Python library designed to make adaptive
    parallel function evaluation simple. With adaptive you just supply a
    function with its bounds, and it will be evaluated at the "best" points
    in parameter space. With just a few lines of code you can evaluate
    functions on a computing cluster, live-plot the data as it returns,
    and fine-tune the adaptive sampling algorithm.
